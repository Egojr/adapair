# Multilevel Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains some of the implementation of the paper: TBD  

By combining AdaCos loss and a Pairwise Cosine Loss we show how to train sentence embeddings following a hierarchical structure.

We provide sample scripts to reproduce the training, evaluation and visualization of the results shown for the MNLI dataset.

For training models refer to the train_triplet and train_adacos_pairwise scripts.  
For evaluation and visualization refer to the test_viz script.   
Sample outputs are shown for testing, to reproduce them yourself train and save the models first.
